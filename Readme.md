# Game Engine
This is a learning project that is based enitrely on [kohi](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) by travisvroman

I understand generally how a game engine should be structured, and I could do it utilizing a library like SDL/SFML or Raylib, but building it from scratch at a near production grade.
Gives me a way deeper understanding of device interactions which was my goal.

The goal is once this is done I could do it again by myself, I could even add some object oriented approaches by using cpp.
